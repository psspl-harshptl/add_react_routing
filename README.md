# Add React Routing

This project demonstrates client-side routing in a React application using **React Router DOM**. It covers defining routes, navigation, and rendering different components based on the URL.

## Features

- **Navigation**: Using `<Link>` and `<NavLink>` for smooth client-side transitions.
- **Dynamic Routing**: Examples of handling route parameters (if applicable).

## Prerequisites
